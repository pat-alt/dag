# dag

A simple module for Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAG). Given a DAG we develop a simple algorithm that identifies all valid adjustment sets. The main functionality is explained in the accompanying Jupyter notebooks:

1. Core functionality [here](causal_graphs_in_action.ipynb).
2. Example graphs [here](examples.ipynb).
